# Craigslist-bot
Python bot that queries craigslist and looks for 'interesting' listings. 
'Interesting' is determined by the 'good words' and results containing 'bad words' removed.

Sends a neat email containing new listings that match the filter & query criteria. 
I built this to find great deals quickly on HiFi vintage audio equitment like stereo recievers and amps. 
Uses SMTP to send HTML rich emails.
